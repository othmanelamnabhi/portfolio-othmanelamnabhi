I've been wanting to learn and play with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for quite some time.

This personal website of mine, is the result of that.

Since Tailwind uses a mobile-first approach, I decided to follow suit and worked on the mobile version before adjusting for the rest of the viewports.

## Features

- light/dark mode
- fully accessible
- full-screen mobile menu
- markdown rendering for blogs
- custom 404 page (try and input a wrong slug üôà)
- ‚ÄúBack to top‚Äù button showing up on scroll
- meta tags to make it easy to share on different social networks
- amazing performance on both mobile and desktop
- favicons for all devices and color theme for browsers that support the color feature

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
